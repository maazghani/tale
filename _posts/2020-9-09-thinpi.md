# parts requests

- 3 raspberry pi 3b+/4/zero
- k3s - lightweight k8s for IoT/ARM
- tailscale - software defined mesh VPN with private DNS built in

![architecture](https://rancher.com/docs/img/rancher/k3s-architecture-single-server.png)



# cluster initialization

 ## download and install
  ```
  curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
  # Check for Ready node, 
  takes maybe 30 seconds
  k3s kubectl get node
  ```
## setup nodes

 ```
K3S_TOKEN=SECRET k3s server --server https://masters-up
```
run on each

# plug A into B
* currently tailscale is available as a downloadable binary for Raspbian but we need to containerize it to run on our k8s cluster
* two options
  * dockerize https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale
  * dockerize these steps:*

```
Raspbian Buster (for Raspbery Pi)

# Add Tailscale's GPG key
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/raspbian/buster.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
# Add the tailscale repository
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/raspbian/buster.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list
# Install Tailscale
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tailscale
# Start Tailscale!
sudo tailscale up
```

# assemble 

- we can do a project like this -- https://tailscale.com/kb/1076/dogcam
- stress test tailscale


# y tho
learn & POC
- lightweight k8s
- mesh VPN for setting up a home base machine as a jumpserver for making ipad pro into a thinclient
- software-defined networks
- hardware maintenance
- how easy to automate cluster management?
